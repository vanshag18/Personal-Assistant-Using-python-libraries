This project is a simple yet powerful voice-enabled Personal Assistant built using Python. It leverages libraries like speech_recognition for understanding voice commands and pyttsx3 for converting text to speech. The assistant can perform a variety of tasks such as answering questions, searching the web, opening applications, telling the time and date, checking weather via APIs, performing calculations, and even sending emails. It provides a hands-free experience by enabling users to interact with their system through natural voice commands. The project uses core Python along with modules like webbrowser, datetime, os, wikipedia, and requests to carry out its functionalities. It is easy to set up and extend, making it an ideal project for learning automation and voice interaction with Python. Future improvements may include integrating a GUI, adding chatbot capabilities, and expanding its scope to mobile platforms using frameworks like Kivy.
